### Approach

This application is built with Javascript, Node.js and npm. I decided to test drive without using a testing framework and wrote my own unit tests. This enabled me to focus on writing methodically solid, expandable code.

I used the module pattern to keep code clean and separated. This allowed me to encapsulate methods within classes.

### User stories
```
As a user,
So that I can start the application,
I want to input a text file of the book.
```
```
As a user,
So that I know how many times each word appears,
I want to count all of the words in a book.
```
```
As a user,
So that I do not count the same word twice,
I want to ignore punctuation and upper cases.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can note any repetition,
I want to count how many times an individual word appears.
```
```
As a user,
So that I make further analysis,
I want to check if the number of times each word appears is a prime number.
```
